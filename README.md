ORGANISM 8: AUTOPOIETIC MORPHODYNAMIC SWARM

100% Emergent Autopoiesis: Zero artificial neural networks, zero reinforcement learning, zero predefined optimization goals.

Absolute Stateless Cognition: No backpropagation, no weight matrices, no memory storage. Pure real-time phase-space synchronization.

Prime Number Gravitational Attractors: Divisor-count topology acts as the sole energetic gradient for zero-entropy morphological crystallization.

Prime Number Gravitational Attractors: Divisor-count topology acts as the sole energetic gradient for zero-entropy morphological crystallization.

Cross-Generational Symbiosis: Spontaneous network formation, localized metabolic death, and talent-transfer reincarnation without central control.

Extreme Computational Velocity: Pure trigonometric physics evaluating millions of phase states per second on a single standard CPU.

[ THE UNIVERSAL DATA SOCKET ]
This is not a closed simulation; it is an open metabolic engine. Feed the EXTERNAL_DATA_STREAM any high-entropy data—raw text hashes, market ticks, noise. Watch a unique digital society spontaneously self-assemble, build a symbiotic web, and evolve entirely from the raw entropy of your inputs.
